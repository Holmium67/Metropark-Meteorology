# Metropark-Meteorology

## How to contribute to this repository

Master: this is the branch where releases will go. Don't touch this

Dev: This is where we push new features to, like an experimental thing. Don't directly touch this.

For any feature/bugfix, MAKE A NEW BRANCH BASED ON DEV

Make your changes on that new branch, and then submit a pull request to merge to dev
This is so we can all work on it together seamlessly, because if we all commit to master simultaneously we WILL break shit
